Detect changes
Preserve files
Resistent to hacking

Detect
¥rules 
	like "check date/size/permissions"
		can patch system to lie
	like "md5 fingerprint"
		slow
		only for key files like top, sh, ps, md5, tar, gzip
		should be resistant to lieing, since file has to be opened to run
	like "set of files in dir"
	like "log file shouldn't shrink"
	processes? often patched to lie
	netstat/
¥Run periodically

Resistant
¥Private copy of files
	md5
	perl
	and other things used to run
	tar
¥Resistant dirs for private copies
	how to prevent rm -Rf?
	can't. can't preserve everything
	
Preserve
¥tar.gz the key dirs/commands

How to allow changes?
	inhibit mechanism ... uh.

		# they return info to be diffed, such that we can tell if a file is changed
		# "file X has changed, is missing..."
		# So, put filename first

Checkpoint
